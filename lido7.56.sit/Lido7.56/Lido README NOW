Changes from Lido 7.55 to 7.56Changes to the code to remove the last remnants of ATTO SE I card.  Changed MO driver to match RM driver.  The old style MOD driver was accidentally left in place in the Lido 7.55 package.  Also fixed the way the Iomega ZIP drive is handled.====================================================================================Changes from Lido 7.54 to 7.55Changed the default behavior for the IBM disk drives.  Previously, we were setting the IBM drives to only handle Non-Blind Writes.  This has been changed to support Blind transfers. ====================================================================================Changes from Lido 7.53 to 7.54Altered the driver so that in the case that it is configured as a hard disk driver, it will ignore the eject system call.  This is to prevent a problem with  Vitrual memory at shutdown or reboot time.The symptoms were, if at reboot or shutdown time, the system would mysteriously hang.  This was becuase the system was trying to write to a non-existent volume. Perhaps this will cure our ills with Speed Doubler / Ram Doubler.  Updated copies of this software is on its way so we should have an answer soon.====================================================================================Changes from Lido 7.2 to 7.53Added new 'sutff' for JAZ.  Now, when you select the SCSI ID for the Iomega JAZ drive, the Easy Setup button in the main window will change to JAZ Setup.   When you click on the JAZ setup button, you will be presented with the option to configure the media for A/V applications or normal Non-A/V applications.Please Note:  The A/V configration changes mode parameters to reduce the error recovery timing.   This may cause the drive to miss blocks during streamed reads and writes.  While this is acceptable for digital video applications, this may not be desireable for your day to day data.  If you use the A/V mode for mission critical data, or for backups, you may run the risk of not recording your information verbatim.Please use the A/V mode only for A/V applications.====================================================================================Changes from Lido 7.51 to 7.52.Corrected mode pages on Conner and Quantum disk drives.  The Conner drives were not properly saving the DUA (Disable Unit Attention) flag.  The Quantum drives had SCAM (SCSI Configure AutoMagically) enabled by default.  The SCAM function would allow the drive to change its SCSI ID at the wrong time during the boot cycle.Enabled the Test Through Driver to be accessed at any time.Added a correction to prevent a single partition from being created that was over 4GB in size.====================================================================================Changes from Lido 7.4 to 7.51.The most important change is the incorporation of a new device driver.  This driver was re-written (almost from scratch) to support the new SCSI manager 4.3 that is incorporated in the PCI Power Macintosh ROMS as well as the System 7.5 SU 2.0 (AKA System 7.5.3).A problem existed whereby removable media drives could be dismounted, but never remounted.  This was caused by internal confusion with the new SCSI manager.  Problem is now fixed.Added extensive support for the JAZ drive.  This includes new Special Menu items that allow setting of the Jaz Sleep timer and the new Rev G60 controller that allows write verification to be manipulated.
