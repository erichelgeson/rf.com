If you intend to use your JAZ cartridge for A/V uses such as Non-Linear Digital Video or any other A/V Application, please select A/V Setup.

If you are going to use your JAZ cartridge for day to day operations, we recommend that you use the Non-A/V setting.

The A/V settings have been optimized to improve the sustained data transfer between the JAZ drive and your computer.  Please use the A/V setting only for A/V applications.
