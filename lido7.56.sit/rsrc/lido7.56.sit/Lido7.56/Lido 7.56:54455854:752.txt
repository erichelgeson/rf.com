Write with Verify on the JAZ.  The write with verify feature causes data to be written and then read from the cartridge to confirm that it was written correctly.  Confirmation is accomplished by verifying that the ECC checks correctly.  The process to do a read(verify) after a write requires an additional revolution of the disk.  Data integrity is improved by using the Write with Verify feature.
