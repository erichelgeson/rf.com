Instructions - The ResEdit ExamplesCopyright Apple Computer, Inc. 1988-1993All rights reserved.These examples should be used with MPW 3.2 or later.About the Examples	A sample resource editor, picker and LDEF are included with ResEdit.  These examples use	the MPW environment, the MPW C or Pascal compiler and the MPW Assembler.	The example editor will simply display a window and invert its contents.	Since the details of editing your resource are known only to you, it is up 	to you to fill in the code necessary to make this into a real editor.		The example picker is an 'ICON' picker.  The 'ICON' LDEF is included with this 	example so that you can see the interaction between a picker and its LDEF.		You can find more details about how to use these examples in the ResEdit manual.	Building the examples	You can build the examples using the build scripts provided in the	folder appropriate for the language you’re using.		The build scripts assume that ResEdit and the Examples folder will be found 	in the directory {boot}ResEdit:.  If these files are located elsewhere, the	build script files should be modified accordingly.		If ResEdit is successfully located, the MakeFile instructions will install	the editor, picker and LDEF directly into ResEdit.  When you are experimenting	with changing any of these files, you may want to build into a copy of ResEdit.	In this way, if anything goes wrong, you can get a fresh copy of ResEdit for your	experiments.		Files included in the Libraries folder	ResDisp.a		The assembly language interface between the editor or picker and the main		ResEdit code.  All of the procedures provided in the ResEd interface file		will be found in this module.  This file should be linked with all editors,		pickers and LDEFs.			RSSC.a		The assembly language interface between ResEdit and your editor or picker.		This file should be linked with your editor or picker.			LDEF.a		The assembly language interface between the List Manager package and your LDEF.  This		file should be linked with your LDEF.		Files included in the CExample and PExamples folders	BuildEditor, BuildPicker, BuildLDEF		The script files used to install the samples into ResEdit.			MakeEditor, MakePicker, MakeLDEF		The Make files used by the build scripts.				Files included in the CExamples:Source: and PExamples:Source: folders	ResEd		The interface file used by all of the example files.  This file provides an		interface to procedures provided by the main ResEdit code.  The contents of this		file are described in the ResEdit manual.			XXXX.Edit		The main code for the editor.  This is the module that should be		modified to implement your editor.	ICON.Pick		The 'ICON' picker from ResEdit.  This file can be used as the starting point		for creating your own picker. The ResEdit manual describes how to create a 		'PICK' resource instead of writing your own picker. You’ll need to remove		the 'PICK' resource named 'ICON' from ResEdit before you can use this example 		'ICON' picker.			ICON.LDEF		The LDEF (list definition procedure) used by the ICON picker.
