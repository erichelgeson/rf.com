I would like to thank my fellow members of the Ridgecrest IEEE Computer Club, Ralph Giles, Jon Richards, Matt Sakai, and Tim Seufert, along with my brother Doug Harris, for their numerous ideas and for all the playtesting that they have done.

I would also like to thank all the people who have registered for RoboWar and have sent me praise, flames, and suggestions.  Their excitement spurred the development of RoboWar 2.0 and later.

Finally, I would like to mention an Apple ][ product of bygone years, Robot Wars.  I have never seen it, but have heard from many RoboWar fans that it is very similar to my implementation of RoboWar.
