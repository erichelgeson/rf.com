Welcome to RoboWar!  In this game, you will design and program robot gladiators, then pit them against each other in a deadly battle.  May victory go to the cleverest!

Features of RoboWar include animated combat, sound effects, color graphics, and a complete programming language, RoboTalk, with an editor, assembler, and interpreter.

ROBOWAR IS SHAREWARE, NOT PUBLIC DOMAIN.

I put a great deal of time into writing the program and RoboTalk language and making improvements for the latest versions.  Feel free to use RoboWar for a trial run, design a robot, and see if you like the program.  If you plan to use it, please send me a $10 shareware fee.
