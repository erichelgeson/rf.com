I would like as many people as possible to register, so I've kept the price low.  Registered users are informed about any updates in RoboWar.  They also may compete in RoboWar tournaments.  RoboWar tournaments are a chance to pit your favorite robots against those of programmers all over the Macintosh world.  Please write or send me email to get the date of the next tournament.

I hope you enjoy RoboWar and will pay your registration.  I welcome any feedback, suggestions, flowers, cookies, or spare Mac hardware you may have.  Happy hacking!

My address is correct at least until May, 1994.  After that time, please send RoboWar inquiries to:  RoboWar HindQuarters / 1112 Evelyn Court / Ridgecrest, CA 93555.
