These partition options include \f0\b0\i0\outl0\shad0\fs18 \cf0 \expan0 \ul0 password-protect\f0\b0\i0\outl0\shad0\fs18 \cf0 \expan0 \ul0 , \f0\b0\i0\outl0\shad0\fs18 \cf0 \expan0 \ul0 read-only\f0\b0\i0\outl0\shad0\fs18 \cf0 \expan0 \ul0 , \f0\b0\i0\outl0\shad0\fs18 \cf0 \expan0 \ul0 boot preference\f0\b0\i0\outl0\shad0\fs18 \cf0 \expan0 \ul0 , and others. It also features a convenient graphical interface for viewing and editing the partitions of your SCSI devices. Extensive analysis tools detect drive or media defects before data loss and system errors occur. A complete benchmarking suite tests device performance. It contains the \f0\b0\i0\outl0\shad0\fs18 \cf0 \expan0 \ul0 only\f0\b0\i0\outl0\shad0\fs18 \cf0 \expan0 \ul0  SCSI driver that can detect a device being accidentally disconnected or turned off AND WAIT FOR IT BEFORE TRYING AGAIN! It is "bullet-proof." Additionally, the application has several advanced capabilities not found in other programs.\line \line The following are a few of \f0\b0\i0\outl0\shad0\fs18 \cf0 \expan0 \ul0 SCSI Director's\f0\b0\i0\outl0\shad0\fs18 \cf0 \expan0 \ul0  other features:\line \line \u8226?

Can be used with third party SCSI accelerator boards for additional SCSI busses\line \line \f0\b0\i0\outl0\shad0\fs18 \cf0 \expan0 \ul0 \line What other utilities besides SCSI Director exist?:\f0\b0\i0\outl0\shad0\fs18 \cf0 \expan0 \ul0 \line Ah, the competition... There are only three major SCSI Utilities that are designed for universal usage on all SCSI devices. They are : Transoft SCSI Director (and various incarnations of SCSI Director), La Cie's SilverLining, and FWB Hard Disk Toolkit. Since the summer of 1991, four minor universal SCSI Utilities, in addition to the three already mentioned, were released. They are Casablanca's Drive 7, Software Architect's Hard Drive TuneUp, Golden Triangle's DiskMaker, and MacPEAK's SpotOn.\line \line Of all these seven products, (there are no others), we are proud to claim that our product probably does more of what most people desire, over all, than all of our six competitors. FWB's Hard Disk \'00\'00\'00\'00\'00\'00\'01\u186?is the only close competitor we have technologically, and of the 14 or so "\u8226?bulleted" features, FWB could probably claim three, or so, of them.\line Without any worthy challenge from the only five other competitors, our SCSI driver itself does much more than theirs or \f0\b0\i0\outl0\shad0\fs20 \cf0 \expan0 \ul0 any SCSI driver ever written.\f0\b0\i0\outl0\shad0\fs18 \cf0 \expan0 \ul0 \line \line We hope you enjoy your experience with \f0\b0\i0\outl0\shad0\fs18 \cf0 \expan0 \ul0 Transoft SCSI Director\f0\b0\i0\outl0\shad0\fs18 \cf0 \expan0 \ul0 , as we continue to improve upon its features, benefits, and user-interface.\f0\b0\i0\outl0\shad0\fs0 \cf0 \expan0 \ul0 \line \line }
