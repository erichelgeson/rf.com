 





Preparing a New SCSI Device
 
Preparing a new SCSI device will destroy all data already on the device. To perform all steps of the set up process, use the “Auto Setup...” button. This will perform a low-level format of the SCSI device, partition the device into one volume, install the SCSI driver, and mount and initialize the volume on the desktop. If you do not want the device partitioned into one volume, you may use the “Partition...” button after the auto setup operation is done (see the “Partitioning Schemes” section in the reference manual, or the next on-line help item).

Alternatively, you may perform the set up process by using the individual buttons “Format...”, “Partition...”, “Install...” (optional), and “Mount...” in succession. You may prefer this method compared to using the “Auto Setup...” button because you have a choice as to the steps you will perform and what options may be chosen at each step. For instance, if you know the device does not need a low-level format you may skip using the “Format...” button. If you want the device partitioned in a different manner, the “Partition...” button will present you with the opportunity to do so (partitioning also installs a SCSI driver onto the device). If you wish to select a different partition icon from that which is default, use the “Install...” button. You may skip using the “Mount...” button and just re-boot the computer, which will allow you to initialize the partitions in the Finder after the computer has started again.

Consult the large reference manual available for the program if more assistance is needed.
