SCSI Director™ is an application that installs a SCSI driver onto most any SCSI-based storage device, including hard disks, optical, Floptical™, and removable media devices. Transoft® SCSI Director™ creates up to 99 SCSI partitions and has a control panel which allows the user to choose partition options without ever entering the application. These partition options include password-protect, read-only, boot preference, and others. It also features a convenient graphical interface for viewing and editing the partitions of your SCSI devices. Extensive analysis tools detect drive or media defects before data loss and system errors occur. A complete benchmarking suite tests device performance. It contains the only SCSI driver that can detect a device being accidentally disconnected or turned off AND WAIT FOR IT BEFORE TRYING AGAIN! It is "bullet-proof." Additionally, the application has several advanced capabilities not found in other programs.

The following are a few of SCSI Director's other features:

• Supports the widest range of devices including all removables
• The ONLY SCSI product that does not need an extension (INIT) for removables
• 50 Selectable partition icons with dynamically displayed SCSI ID number
• Absolute control of creating HFS and A/UX 3.0 style partitions
• Block level device to device copy utility, and partition copier
• Archival utilities for backing up partitions to files
• Extensive scrolling styled On-Line Help files
• Advanced "hacker" menu with an array of low-level disk tools
• No system extensions (INITs) or trap patching used, unlike other programs!
• Intelligently shares one copy of the driver to save memory
• Contains a utility to copy files and folders 2 to 3 times faster than the Finder
• Supports "cartridge-to-cartridge" copy in the Finder similar to floppies!
• Compatibility with System 7.0 features, since it came out and before
• Can be used with third party SCSI accelerator boards for additional SCSI busses


What other utilities besides SCSI Director exist?:
Ah, the competition... There are only three major SCSI Utilities that are designed for universal usage on all SCSI devices. They are : Transoft SCSI Director (and various incarnations of SCSI Director), La Cie's SilverLining, and FWB Hard Disk Toolkit. Since the summer of 1991, four minor universal SCSI Utilities, in addition to the three already mentioned, were released. They are Casablanca's Drive 7, Software Architect's Hard Drive TuneUp, Golden Triangle's DiskMaker, and MacPEAK's SpotOn.

Of all these seven products, (there are no others), we are proud to claim that our product probably does more of what most people desire, over all, than all of our six competitors. FWB's Hard Disk ºis the only close competitor we have technologically, and of the 14 or so "•bulleted" features, FWB could probably claim three, or so, of them.
Without any worthy challenge from the only five other competitors, our SCSI driver itself does much more than theirs or any SCSI driver ever written.

We hope you enjoy your experience with Transoft SCSI Director, as we continue to improve upon its features, benefits, and user-interface.
