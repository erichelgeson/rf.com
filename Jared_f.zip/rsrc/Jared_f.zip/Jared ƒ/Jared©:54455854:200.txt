While Central America has seen more than its share of atrocities in recent years; never before has a lovely Guatemalan folk song been brutalized as thoroughly as by the vocal stylings of JARED, the Head of Security at FREEVERSE SOFTWARE. 

Like an angry Immigration officer, Jared's distinctive rendition grabs us, slaps us around, threatens to cavity search us and ultimately demands our passport be issued from that same circle of hell from which his voice originates.

Never has the mating of cats sounded so melodic as after  one has listened to "El Carnicero de Canciones,"  the "Butcher of Songs,"  as Jared was known in Guatemala. Yet, this is perhaps the worst part; one is somehow drawn to his song, playing it over and over again.   So listen to, "Shala-uuugh", and suffer -- for this is art.
