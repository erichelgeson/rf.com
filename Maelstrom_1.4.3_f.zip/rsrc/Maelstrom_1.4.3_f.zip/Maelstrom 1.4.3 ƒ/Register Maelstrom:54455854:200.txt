^0 is distributed as shareware.  You are permitted to use it on a trial basis for up to 30 days.  If you wish to continue using ^0 beyond that period, you are expected to pay a registration fee to obtain a license to use ^0.

After we have processed your registration, we will send you a license code that you enter to complete the registration process.  This removes the shareware notices and personalizes your copy of ^0.

^0 has a $^1 registration fee.  Upgrades from previous versions are free.

We don’t cripple our products.  We don’t gouge you with absurd prices.  We don’t fool you into buying our software with slick advertising.

What we ask is this: if you like our products, support us by paying for them.  If you don't like our products, don't use them (or better yet, tell us why you don't like them so we can improve them).
