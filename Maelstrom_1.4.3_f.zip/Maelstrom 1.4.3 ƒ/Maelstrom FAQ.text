The end result is a nerve-wracking arcade game that is sure to leave blisters on your fingers.      Maelstrom has been given a 4.27 out of 5.0 in Inside Mac Games's player satisfaction poll. This puts Ambrosia's feisty $15 shareware program among the top ten ranked games, with expensive retail titles such as Hellcats Over The Pacific, Myst, Sim City 2000, and F/A-18 Hornet. Maelstrom also received a four star rating from Macworld, won the Shareware Industry Award for Best Mac Program, MacUser's Shareware/Entertainment Software award, and MacUser UK's Best Entertainment Software Award......[Q] - What computer do I need in order to play Maelstrom?[A] - Maelstrom works on any Macintosh with a 256 color display and at least 2.3mb of free memory.  Unlike many arcade-style games, Maelstrom does work on 12" monitors......[Q] - Who makes Maelstrom and how can I get in touch with them?[A] - Maelstrom is published as shareware by Ambrosia Software, Inc., a Macintosh-only, shareware-only company.

If you still have a problem with your license code not working, please get in contact with us and we will take care of the situation for you......[Q] - Will Maelstrom ever be ported to DOS?[A] - Despite a number of requests, we have no plans to port Maelstrom over to DOS/Windows.  We lack the know-how, time, and inclination to undertake such a project, so it doesn't look like it is going to happen.  Sure is nice for the shoe to be on the other foot for once, no?  :).....[Q] - Will there be future versions of Maelstrom?[A] - We consider Maelstrom a "done" work.  We will of course continue to maintain the game by fixing bugs and adding ancillary features, but short of a sequel, we will not be making changes to the basic game itself.      Note: we are not announcing that there will be a sequel to Maelstrom, just that it is a possibility......Game Play_________________________________________________________________[Q] - What are the point values for the various baddies in Maelstrom?[A] - Maelstrom Scores Breakdown:      Small Asteroid                   300 points      Medium Asteroid                  100 points      Big Asteroid                      50 points      Vortex                           500 points      Shenobi Autonominous Mine        700 points      Star going Nova                 1000 points      Shooting a Steel Asteroid        100 points      Destroying a Steel Asteroid     5000 points      Large Enemy                     1000 points      Small Shenobi Fighter           2000 points [yes, the Steel Asteroids can be destroyed if you are persistent enough].....[Q] - What does the "luck" yummy do?[A] - Luck gives you a 1 in 3 chance of saving your ship when you should have died (you'll hear "Sweet!" if that happens) and a 1 in 3 chance of keeping your special weapons when you do die.  Remember, lady luck is a fickle mistress......[Q] - How can I pause or abort a game of Maelstrom?[A] - The Caps Lock key pauses Maelstrom while you are in the middle of a game, allowing you to take a breather or switch out to another application if you desire.  To resume a game after you've paused it, simply depress the Caps Lock key.      The ESC (escape) key aborts the game you're playing. This is not a "quit" key, but an "end the game because the pizza's here" key. It is only operational when you are playing the game......[Q] - What is the optimal control configuration for playing Maelstrom?[A] - You should usually keep the Maelstrom controls set to the "factory default."  Some new Apple keyboards don't allow for more than two keys to be down simultaneously, which can inhibit good game play.  However the Shift, Option, Control, and Command keys don't count as real keys, so if you have a few of Maelstrom's controls set to these keys (as in the "factory default" controls), you'll have much better control over your ship......[Q] - When do comets/multipliers/supply canisters appear?[A] - When a new level is started, Maelstrom determines ahead of time if a comet, multiplier, or supply canister will appear.  These items will appear within 30 seconds after starting a wave, or they won't appear at all......[Q] - Is there such a thing as an "empty" supply canister?[A] - There are no "dud" supply canisters.  You may however get a present that you already have, or you may get a canister that gives you more shield power......[Q] - Is there any kind of an end to the game?[A] - No.  Maelstrom just continues to get harder and harder as you proceed through the game.  There are as many waves in Maelstrom as you can handle......[Q] - How can I cheat while playing Maelstrom?[A] - To access the "cheat mode," hit the 'L' key at the main screen.  A dialog box will appear that allows you to choose the starting wave, number of lives, and turbofunk option.  You won't be able to get a high score if you use this "cheat mode," but it is a good way to practice......[Q] - Do you have any hints or tips for playing Maelstrom?[A] - I'm glad you asked, here's the official Ed "DAMAGE" Ota guide to total Maelstrom destruction:      ¥ Learn how to fly the ship so you do not become shield dependent.      ¥ Stay away from the borders, visibility is limited and you could         get a nasty surprise.      ¥ Concentrate on one asteroid at a time, this will limit the amount         of debris floating around.      ¥ Better to shoot at a distance, large asteroids shatter into small         ones that could take you out.      ¥ Spread your shots out when shooting a large asteroid. This will         take out some of the smaller ones.       ¥ Configure the ship control keys the way you feel most comfortable.      ¥ Shoot vortex's to get rid of them.      ¥ Shoot floating autonominous mines (6 hits Approx.), if you run         away it will only track you down.      ¥ Keep moving when a Shenobi ship appears. Staying put makes you         easy prey.      ¥ Move quickly to get canisters and bonus points. They do not stick         around for long. Canisters make about three passes.      ¥ It is better to stop or turn around a steel asteroid with shots         then it is to throw on the shields and get bounced across the         screen.      ¥ A fast moving steel asteroid is like a derailed freight train,         stay out of their way and try to slow them down with shots from         the opposite direction.      ¥ Multiple shots will destroy a steel asteroid, but between the         first shot and last shot is a very pissed off asteroid.      ¥ After eliminating the last asteroid you have a small amount of         grace time. Bonus points will continue to add up, but if you lose         a ship it is not counted against you. Move quickly and         aggressively to attack Shenobi ships or pick up bonus items         during this time.      ¥ Use a sweeping motion to get maximum effect from machine guns.      ¥ Spare the last asteroid for a while to rack up bonus points and         benefits. Beware of the Shenobi ships though, don't get too         greedy.      ¥ When using the spray gun to go after large asteroids, close in for         the kill. This will allow you to eliminate all of the little         asteroids after the first hit.      ¥ A circular motion will allow you to wipe out almost everything         when using the long range shots. But there may be a few stubborn         rocks you have to concentrate on.      ¥ The smaller Shenobi ships are smaller, "smarter" and more         aggressive.  It may be wise to avoid these mighty midgets.      ¥ As in life, always try to stay a step ahead of the game. Try to         predict your next move, if you can do this, you will do well in         Maelstrom......Compatability_________________________________________________________________[Q] - When I start Maelstrom, the screen freezes and it makes a funny sound; what's wrong?[A] - Congratulations, you've found Maelstrom's pause function!  Maelstrom uses the Caps Lock key for pausing the game; simply depress the Caps Lock key and you'll be able to continue playing Maelstrom......[Q] - Does Maelstrom work on a PowerMac?  Is it PowerPC native?[A] - Maelstrom works just fine on all PowerMacs.  In fact we heard a little rumour that Apple used Maelstrom to speed-test its 68K emulator (because Maelstrom uses very few Macintosh Toolbox routines).      However Maelstrom will never be PowerPC native.  It runs just fine under emulation, much of the game is written in 68K assembler (and thus would have to be rewritten), and there would be very little benefit in having a native version of the game because the speed under emulation is just fine......[Q] - Does Maelstrom work with System 7.5?[A] - Yes, Maelstrom works just fine with System 7.5.  The "Before you install" program will tell you that Maelstrom "may not work with System 7.5," but it is incorrect.      The way the "Before you install" program works is as follows: there is an internal database of programs known to work with System 7.5, and an internal database of programs known not to work with System 7.5.  If any program is not listed in either database, the "Before you install" program errs on the side of caution and tells you that the program "may not work with System 7.5."     Rest assured, Maelstrom works just fine under System 7.5.  That's the System version we are currently using in the Ambrosia home office while we are playing -- I mean testing -- Maelstrom......[Q] - When playing Maelstrom, sometimes the ship continues to thrust or spin  out of control.  What causes this?[A] - Apple's control panel "Easy Access" can cause problems for Maelstrom if you have the shift key set as one of the ship controls (as it is initially).  Easy Access is a program that makes it easier for a disabled person to use the Macintosh.  You may not even realize it is installed, and if you don't use it you might as well throw it out.      Here's how to check.  Under System 6, open up the System Folder and look for a file called "Easy Access."  If it is there, remove it from your System Folder and reboot.  Under System 7, open up the Control Panels folder in the System Folder and look for a file called "Easy Access."  Again, if it is there, remove it from the Control Panels folder......[Q] - Why doesn't Maelstrom use the full screen on large monitors?[A] - Some people have asked that Maelstrom take advantage of screens larger than the standard Apple 14" monitor.  Maelstrom already does: it centers the game window on such larger screens, and puts a border around the game play area.      If Maelstrom expanded to fill the entire size of a large-screen monitor, game play would be altered radically because it would be much easier to play the game with a larger game play area.  In short: though it could be done, it won't be done because we want game play to be consistent no matter what machine you play Maelstrom on......[Q] - Why does the sound occasionally break up?[A] - Certain video cards may cause the sound to break up during fades.  This is because all video card drivers turn off interrupts while they are changing color table entries, and some video cards do not handle color table changes in an optimal manner.  Since interrupts are off while the video card is changing color table entries, the Sound Manager cannot service the sound chip quickly enough, and the sound breaks up......[Q] - Will Virtual Memory or RAM Doubler affect game play?[A] - If you have virtual memory turned on or are using the RAM Doubler extension, it may slow down Maelstrom's game play.  This is unavoidable; the only solution is to turn virtual memory or RAM Doubler off before playing Maelstrom.      On slower machines, virtual memory or RAM Doubler may also cause the sound to breakup or screech on occasion.  We recommend against using virtual memory or RAM Doubler while playing Maelstrom (or any other game for that matter), but it does work......History_________________________________________________________________[Q] - What does "Maelstrom" mean?[A] - Maelstrom - 1. any large or violent whirlpool   2. a violently confused or dangerously agitated state of mind, emotion, affairs, etc......[Q] - What language is Maelstrom written in?[A] - Maelstrom was written in THINK C 5.04.  The main portion of the game is in approximately 9,000 lines of assembler.  The non-critical and supporting portions of the game are in approximately 18,000 lines of plain old C.  Maelstrom uses custom blitting routines for optimal animation performance......[Q] - Who did the artwork for Maelstrom?[A] - Ian Gilman did the animation and sprite artwork.  Mark W. Lewis did the title screen artwork.  Both are quite talented, in addition to being very nice guys......[Q] - When was Maelstrom first released?[A] - Maelstrom was first released in November of 1992......[Q] - How long did it take to create Maelstrom?[A] - The initial (1.0.0) version of Maelstrom took approximately 4 months of sleepless days and nights to create.  Subsequent versions (bug fixes, enhancements, etc.) have been done over the course of 3 years......End_________________________________________________________________
