Bonds are moneys loaned to you by the public which you must repay at a given interest rate.  The rate on these bonds is based on the prime rate plus a percentage based on your city value.  The best rate is prime+1%.  Given that the prime rate changes from year to year, it is possible to have an outstanding bond with a rate that is lower than the current prime.
