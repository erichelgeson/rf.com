'Launch' Arcologies were nicknamed for their resemblance to modern orbital launchers.  The resemblance is not entirely coincidental, as sophisticated methods of biological support were necessary to oxygenate and feed the thousands of inhabitants. While never tested, the manufacturers claim the occupants could stay self-contained for up to two decades.  The sides of the Arcology are equipped with vernier jets to stabilize the structure during storms and earthquakes.  A small nuclear facility independently powers the building; spare energy is stored by electrolyzing water into two tanks for oxygen and hydrogen.
The 'Launch Arco' is the largest, costing $200,000 and holding 65,000 inhabitants.  Build enough of these and you may discover the final secret of SimEarthÂ®.
