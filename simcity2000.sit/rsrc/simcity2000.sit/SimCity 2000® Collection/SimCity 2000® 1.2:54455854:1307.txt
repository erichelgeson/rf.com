This column shows the Year To Date revenues and expenses.  This is the money that has accumulated during the current budget year.  It will not be added or subtracted from current funds until the year's end.  If the number in this column baffles you, open the book to the right for detailed information.  
Example: A police department costs $100 per year to maintain.  If it were built in September, then it would only cost $33 for the year (one-third of a year).  If it were set to 50% funding in July, it would cost $75 for the year ($50 for the first half, $25 for the second).
