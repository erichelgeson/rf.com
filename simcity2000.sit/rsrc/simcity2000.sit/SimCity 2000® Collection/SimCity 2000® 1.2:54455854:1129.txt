															BUILDING LAYER

This button will flatten your buildings, allowing you to examine your roads, wires and other infrastructure.  You will recognize the building types by their color:  green - residential, blue - commercial, yellow - industrial, orange - city structures, grey - port structures. In under-view, the zone colors will be shown as outlines instead of colored-in squares.
