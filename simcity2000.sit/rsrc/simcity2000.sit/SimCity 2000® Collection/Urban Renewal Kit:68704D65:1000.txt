Actual Text: 'Using Pick & CopyPick & Copy copies objects from a source object set to a working object set. Use it to build object sets which have your own art work and (perhaps) the art work of others. You can change both the source and the working object sets from the Pick & Copy Menus (as well as from Paint the Town and Place & Print menus) at any time.First load a working object set (the set you want to build), then load a source object set (which has objects you want to copy). Open the Object Group Menu and select the group which has the specific objects you want to copy. This helps focus your search for specific objects. Make your selections by clicking on a single object in the Source part of the Pick & Copy Object Selector, then drag them to the Working part. If you click and drag while holding down the Shift key, you can select a region of objects at once, or select and de-select single objects by holding down the Command key while clicking. You can also use the Copy commands from the Pick & Copy Edit Menu. These changes can be used immediately in Paint the Town and Place & Print. When you're happy with your changes, save your Working set.There are just two restrictions. You can only copy objects from the Source set to their equivalent objects in the Working set. Also, you make changes to the Working set only. Nothing you do has any effect on the Source set.'
