														MAP DISPLAY/WINDOW

This button brings up a pop-up map display.  Hold down the mouse button to view it.  You may 'tear away' the display to create a Map window.  Drag the display away from the toolbar and release the mouse button.

The map display shows a small, overhead view of your city.  The map window has buttons to the left that allow you to view information such as 'Police Power', 'Crime Rate' and 'Pollution'.
