Actual Text: 'Paint The Town Object SelectorThe Paint the Town Object Selector is where you choose the object you want to work on in the Drawing Area. Here's how to use it:1.	Open the File menu, select the Open Working Object Set... menu item.  then choose the existing object set you want to edit.2.	Open the Object Group menu and select a group of objects (the default is All)3.	Click on the Object Selector arrow until you see the object you want to edit. If the objects don't change, it means you are at one end of a group of objects. Simply click the other arrow.4.	Click on the object you want to edit to load it into the Drawing Area, ready for creative talents to go wild.---Texture PaletteLets you choose from a selection of pre-designed texture patterns. Click on the pattern of your choice. A red square marks the active texture. The solid white pattern at the top-left, uses only the foreground (f) color. The gray pattern in the middle of the top row mixes foreground and background (b) into a third color. The black pattern at the top right uses only the background color. All other textures can use both foreground and background colors, and accept any color or part of any cycle pattern as either foreground or background.---Brush SizeLets you set the size and/or thickness of the dots, lines and shapes you draw (or erase) to a one-, two-, three-, four-, five- or six-pixel square. The four and five pixel sizes can also have rounded corners. Brush Size affects the Free Drawing tool, Eraser, Line tool and all the shape tools. Larger brush sizes soften the corners of the Diamond, Left Wall and Right Wall shapes.---Color PaletteClick on a color to choose a "foreground" color. Hold the Option key and click on a color  to choose a "background" color. Cycling colors are at the end of this palette.---Paint The Town Drawing AreaThe Paint the Town Drawing Area is where you modify our graphics and create your own. The set of graphics you are using is always the working object set. The objects in the Drawing Area are displayed larger than they'll be in SimCity 2000, so you can more easily see the details while drawing them. The display size can be adjusted with the Zoom In and Zoom Out tools in the Toolbox.Each object (even when it is blank) has a set base size. The Drawing Area always displays a four-by-four base, but you can't always use the whole base - only as much of the base as the object you are drawing or editing has. Base sizes cannot be changed. The height limit of each object is the top of the Drawing Area.SCURK will instantly and automatically erase (clip) anything you draw or paste outside an object's base size or above the Drawing Area. An easy way to keep track of the base size limit while painting an object is to turn on the Show Clip Region display. The Clip Region defines the part of the Drawing Area that can be used for a particular object. It is always active, but is only displayed when you want to see it. To turn on the Clip Region display, open the Options menu and select Show Clip Region. Select it again to turn it off.---Free Drawing ToolThis Paint the Town button turns your cursor into a free-style drawing tool. Click or click and drag the mouse in the Drawing Area to use it. While active (and within the Drawing Area), the cursor will appear as a crosshair. The size of dots and lines that this tool draws depends on the brush size.---EraserThis Paint the Town button turns your cursor into an eraser. Click or click and drag the mouse in the Drawing Area to use it. While active (and within the Drawing Area), the cursor will appear as an crosshair. The area that this tool erases depends on the brush size.---Line ToolThis Paint the Town button lets you draw a straight line at any angle. Click and hold to begin the line, drag the mouse to define the line, then release the mouse button to draw the line.While active (and within the Drawing Area), the cursor will appear as a crosshair. The thickness of the line depends on the brush size.---Diamond ToolThis Paint the Town button lets you draw diamond shapes, perfect for floors and ceilings of SimCity 2000 objects. Click and hold to choose one corner of the diamond, drag the mouse until the diamond is the size you want, then release the mouse button. While active (and within the Drawing Area), the cursor will appear as a crosshair. The thickness of the diamond's outline depends on the brush size. Click and hold on this button again to open a submenu that lets you choose between a hollow and a filled shape.---Left Wall ToolThis Paint the Town button lets you draw parallelograms for left walls of buildings in the proper SimCity 2000 perspective. Of course, you can use it for other things if you choose. Click and hold to choose one corner of the wall, drag the mouse until the wall is the size you want, then release the mouse button. While active (and in the Drawing Area), the cursor is a crosshair. The thickness of the wall's outline depends on the brush size. Click and hold on this button again to open a submenu that lets you choose between a hollow and a filled shape. ---Right Wall ToolThis Paint the Town button lets you draw parallelograms for right walls of buildings in the proper SimCity 2000 perspective. Of course, you can use it for other things if you choose. Click and hold to choose one corner of the wall, drag the mouse until the wall is the size you want, then release the mouse button. While active (and in the Drawing Area), the cursor is a crosshair. The thickness of the wall's outline depends on the brush size. Click and hold on this button again to open a submenu that lets you choose between a hollow and a filled shape. ---CircleThis Paint the Town button lets you draw circles and ellipses. Click and drag the mouse until the circle is the size - and shape - you want, then release the mouse button. While active (and within the Drawing Area), the cursor will appear as a crosshair. The thickness of the circle's outline depends on the brush size. Click and hold on this button again to open a submenu that lets you choose between a hollow and a filled shape.---BoxThis Paint the Town Button lets you draw squares and rectangles. Click and drag the mouse until the box is the size - and shape - you want, then release the mouse button. While active (and within the Drawing Area), the cursor will appear as a crosshair. The thickness of the box's outline depends on the brush size. Click and hold on this button again to open a submenu that lets you choose between a hollow and a filled shape.---FillThis Paint the Town button lets you fill an area with the selected color, color cycle, or texture. It begins where you click in the Drawing Area and fills in all directions until it comes to another color. Fill considers each color of a color cycle pattern to be a different color, so filling over color cycled areas isn't very effective. While active (and within the Drawing Area), the cursor will appear as a crosshair.---EyedropperThis Paint the Town button lets you set the brush color by selecting a foreground color or a background color from within the Drawing Area (so you don't have to find the color in the palette). Click on the color you want with the mouse button to choose a foreground color. Hold the Option key and click on a color with mouse button to select a background color. While active (and within the Drawing Area), the cursor will appear as a crosshair.---Zoom Out - Paint the TownThis Paint The Town tool lets you "step back" from the Drawing Area for a "Big Picture" look of your work. There are five zoom levels. These are zoom levels above and beyond the three zoom levels that appear in SimCity 2000. They exist to make drawing easier, and do not affect the actual artwork. ---Zoom In - Paint the TownThis Paint the Town tool moves you up close in the Drawing Area for those dot-by-dot corrections which can make all the difference between good work and great art. There are five zoom levels. These are zoom levels above and beyond the three zoom levels that appear in SimCity 2000. They exist to make drawing easier, and do not affect the actual artwork.---Copy ToolUse this to copy a portion of the object in the Drawing Area to a special SCURK only clipboard. Rotate, Flip Horizontally, Flip Vertically and the Paste button work on this clipboard.'
