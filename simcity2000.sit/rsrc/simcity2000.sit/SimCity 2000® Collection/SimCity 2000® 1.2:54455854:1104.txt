															WATER

Pipes - These transmit water and carry away sewage.  You need powered water pumps to generate water.

Water Pump - Powered pumps will generate water for your city.  The amount they produce is increased by placing them next to standing water.  It also has a seasonal variance depending on rainfall.

Water Tower - Water towers store water to combat seasonal variation.

Treatment - Adding a treatment plant reduces your city-wide pollution levels.

Desalinization - Water pumps will not pump sea water.  A desalinization plant will take sea water and produce pure water for your city.
