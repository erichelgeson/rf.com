															ROADS

Road - This is your primary method of transport.  Roads connect zones, allowing them to grow.

Highway - Highways are faster and more efficient than roads.  Commuters will move from road to onramps, then to highways, back to onramps, then on to roads again.  Without the roads and on-ramps, highway are useless.

Tunnel - Tunnels dig through a mountain rather than going over it.  One advantage to tunnels is that zones can be built over tunneled areas, improving land usage.

Onramp - These are necessary for highways to function.  They can only be placed at a highway/road juncture.

Bus Depot - Depots provide rapid, low traffic transport.  Up to half of your city's commuters will use these depots if they are well placed.
