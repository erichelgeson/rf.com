															PLACE SIGN

This tool is used to place signs (labels) in your city. To use it just click on the city location where you want it placed and then enter the text for it. These can be used to name streets, subdivisions, lakes, etc. Or you may use this for jotting down notes to yourself about future plans for each area. 
These signs can be toggled on and off with the layer control button near the bottom of the City toolbar. To erase a sign, click on the base with the sign tool to open the record, then hit the delete key.
