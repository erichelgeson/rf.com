															RAIL

Rail - This transport method is efficient and traffic free.  You must carefully place your rail depots, or else the rail will go unused.

Subway - These are underground railways.  They operate like rail, except that subways need subway stations to operate. 

Rail Depot - This is where commuters enter and exit the rail system.

Sub Station - This is where commuters enter and exit the subway system.

Sub<-->Rail - This allows you to connect your above-ground rail with your below-ground subway.  You must place this next to an existing rail line.
