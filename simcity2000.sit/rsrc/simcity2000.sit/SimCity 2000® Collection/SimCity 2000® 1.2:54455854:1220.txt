CENTER DISPLAY - This is the centering tool. It is used to scroll around your city. When you click in the window the scene will re-center on the place you clicked. If you click near the center of the window and hold the mouse button down, you can then smoothly scroll around by moving the mouse to adjust direction and speed.
