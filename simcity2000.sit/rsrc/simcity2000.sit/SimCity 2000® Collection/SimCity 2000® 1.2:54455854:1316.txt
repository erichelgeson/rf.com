Your city transit costs are broken down into six categories: Road, Highway, Bridge, Rail, Subway, Tunnel.  When your maintenance is less than 100%, these vital city services start to decay.  Roads, rails, and highways turn to rubble.  Sections of subway collapse.  Bridges and tunnels become unstable.
You might reduce some of these expenses for a year or two during a financial crisis, but extended cutbacks will strangle your city.
