SimCity 2000® 1.2
has been copyrighted by
Maxis, 1993-95.


Fred Haslam & Will Wright
spent altogether too much
of their lives thinking about
SimCity 2000® and bringing
their thoughts to life on the
Macintosh.

Mick Foley shot shapes,
packed them into a city,
and moved SimCity 2000®
to the Power Macintosh,
while Justin McCormick
went bug hunting and
caught the big nasty ones.
John “USPA87419” Lewis
even helped a bit. (He’ll do
anything for some free
caffeine.)

Don Walters managed to get
everything to happen when
it was supposed to happen
without pulling his hair out.


Very Special Thanks To:
My Maw


Jenny Martin ensured that
Suzie Greene,
Bonnie Borucki,
Kelli Pearson
& Eben Sorkin
created the most beautiful
graphics ever seen for this
product (and they did).

Sue Kasper, Brian Conrad,
and Justin McCormick gave
up promising careers as
karaoke singers to create
the music for SimCity 2000®.

Halestorm, Inc. gave us the
tools to help you hear the
sounds of the city as well as
a few of those cool sounds.

The Maxis Sample Heds
stayed up dark nights in late
rooms making weird noises
into microphones.

Brian Conrad also made sure
we were dialed in to the cool
hardware action.

Fred Haslam, Debra Larson,
Chris Weiss, VERBed over
an ADJECTIVE NOUN for
hours on end to create
the EXCLAMATION
SimCity 2000® Newspaper.

To ground ourselves into
reality we called upon:
Bruce Joffe
(GIS Consultant),
Craig Christenson
(National Renewable
Energy  Laboratory),
Ray Gatchalian
(Oakland Fire Department),
Diane L. Zahm
(Florida Department of
Law Enforcement)

Michael Bremer got sick of
us moaning over his puns,
so he sat down and put them
in another fantastic manual.
(so now you too can moan
over his puns).

Tom Bentley & Debra Larson
made sure at least half of
Michael's puns were funny
an speld corekly.

Vera Jaye made sure that
the SimCity 2000® box wasn't
just another face in the crowd.

David Caggiano pushed
pictures around on pages
with exceptional talent until
things looked marvelous.

Kristine Brogno made sure
that Vera's & Dave's shoes
(and loose ends) were tied.

When Michael couldn't figure
out how to play the game,
Fred, Will, Don, and Kathleen
helped him out. Sometimes.

Additional material for the
wonderful, biodegradable
manual was contributed by:
John "Bean" Hastings
Richard E. Bartlett, AIA
Margo Lockwood
Larry Wilson,
David Caggiano
Tom Bentley
Barbara Pollak
Emily Friedman
Keith Ferrell
James Hewes
Joey Holliday
and last
(but assuredly not least)
William Holliday

Larry Lee invented ways to
make people who had never
heard of SimCity 2000® buy
this stupendous sequel.

Sam Poole and his spunky
bunch made sure that the
stores those people go to
actually had SimCity 2000®
available for YOU.

Chris Weiss had to force
Don Horat, Roger Johnsen,
and Manny Granillo to play
SimCity 2000® for hours at
gunpoint and make sure
everything worked like it
was supposed to.

In addition to the normal
software testing crew:
Rob McNamara
Steve Perrin
Kirk Lesser
Carter Lipscomb
Chris Blackwell
Kevin O'Hare
Peter Alau
Tari Kobylanski
&
Bob Sombrio

Alan Barton made sure that
Chris never actually pulled
the trigger.

If (heaven forbid) you have
a problem with SimCity 2000®
and need to talk to someone,
chances are you'll be hearing
the charming voice of Carter
Lipscomb, Kevin O'Hare, Chris
Blackwell, Peter Alau,
or Kirk Lesser.

Everyone who worked on the
project felt for one reason
or another these people
deserved special mention:

Joe Scirica for making sure
we stayed out of jail, passed
Go and collected $200.

Jeff Braun, who loves Maxis,
runs Maxis, and IS Maxis
(and we thank him for that).

Jim Siefert for comic relief.

Bob Derber for keeping us
out of court and similar
noteworthy achievements.

Michael Perry, because he
has long hair and we don’t.

Cassidy Wright and Joell
Jones who had to put up
with Will’s weird hours. 

Michael Wyman
& Bob Sombrio
for special news bulletins.

Everyone else who punches
the clock at Maxis (like it's
the worst job we could find).

George and Denny (and even
Slo-Mo Pete) at the Casa 
Orinda for many excellent
free peanuts and something
to wash them down with.

Our good friends: "Big Al", 
Rose, Kurt, and the rest at 
Ottino's for lunch, dinner, 
dessert, TV, and popcorn.

The nice people downstairs
at Caffe Teatro who sell us
gallons of coffee every day
because we need it.

Denny and Jim at Whole Earth
Access for lettin' us test on
their toys

Victor Romero
the cleaning guy

Lisa Lee and The Two Carols
(Cabrillo and Lockwood) at
Apple's 3rd Party Test Labs.

Lucy and Lola
The Amazing Flying Puglets

Jiffyburgers and Mitzbitz

The gang at MindVision software 
(makers of Developer Vice 
installation software) for 
service above and beyond 
the call of duty.

All the great folks at SkyDance
SkyDiving in Davis, CA who let
John Lewis hurl himself out of
their fine airplanes. (This may seem
strange, but he says it helps him
relax. Something about work not
mattering much when hurtling
towards the ground at 120+ MPH.)
