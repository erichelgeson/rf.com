The Plymouth Arco is "Solid as a Rock", or so claims Plymouth Arcologies, Inc.  It is known that they have stood through several earthquakes, notably in the NeoRepublic of Mexico and the Taiwan CoProsperity Region.  Plymouth Arcologies are designed primarily to support heavy industries, as witness Greenland Motors, maker of the Narwhal 3000.  This might not be such a good choice if you are overly concerned about pollution.
Plymouth Arcos cost $100,000 and can attract up to 55,000 residents.
