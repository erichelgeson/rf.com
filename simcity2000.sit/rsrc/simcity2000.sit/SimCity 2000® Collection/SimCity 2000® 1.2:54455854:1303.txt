This is the status region of the budget.  It gives your city name, the current year and month.  When the budget window automatically opens each January, it will also contain an hourglass that slowly empties unless you click in the window.  When the sands run out, SimCity 2000Â® assumes that the mayor is out to lunch and resumes the simulation.
