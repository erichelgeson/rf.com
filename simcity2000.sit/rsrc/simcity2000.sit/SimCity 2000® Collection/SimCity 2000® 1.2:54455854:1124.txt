											POPULATION DISPLAY/WINDOW

This button brings up a pop-up population display.  Hold down the mouse button to view it.  You may 'tear away' the display to create a Population window.  Drag the display away from the toolbar and release the mouse button.

This window is used to follow trends in your population.  It will show the education, population and health for each age-group in your city.  The technical name for this kind of display is a cohort-population graph.
