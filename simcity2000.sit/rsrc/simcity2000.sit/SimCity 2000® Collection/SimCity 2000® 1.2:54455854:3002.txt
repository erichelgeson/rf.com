At present, cities stay where they are.

For now cities sleep.

But there are rumblings. Things change. And what if, tommorrow, the cities wake, and go walking? If Tokyo engulfed your town? If Vienna came striding over the hill toword you? If the city you inhabit today just upped and left, and you woke tommorrow wrapped in a thin blanket on an empty plain, where Detroit once stood, or Sydney, or Moscow?

Don't ever take a city for granted.

After all, it is bigger than you are; it is older; and it has learned how to wait...
