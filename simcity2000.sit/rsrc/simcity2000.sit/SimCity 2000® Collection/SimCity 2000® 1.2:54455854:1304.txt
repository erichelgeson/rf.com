This area shows the cash left over from the previous budget period, the amount of money accumulated this year, and the estimated total funds for the full year.  Estimated and accrued funds are not added into current funds until the year's end.
Sometimes the totals for To Date Expenses and Year End Estimate do not add up.  This is due to each category having fractional amounts that aren't shown.  For example, if Property Taxes earn 4.5 dollars and Ordinances gather 3.5 dollars, they will be displayed as 4 and 3 respectively, but the total is still 8.
