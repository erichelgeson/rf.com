												NEIGHBORS DISPLAY/WINDOW

This button brings up a pop-up neighbors display.  Hold down the mouse button to view it.  You may 'tear away' the display to create a Neighbors window.  Drag the display away from the toolbar and release the mouse button.

This shows the names and size of your regional neighbors, allowing you to compare your perfomance to your neighbors'.  It also shows the size of the nation your city occupies.
