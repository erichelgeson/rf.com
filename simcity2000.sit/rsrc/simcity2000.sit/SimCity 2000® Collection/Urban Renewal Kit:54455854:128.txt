Extra Special Thanks to
Joe Scirica for putting his body on the line (the 2nd base line).
Sam Poole, Bob Derber, Fred Gerson, and Jeff Braun for making us stinking rich.
Alan Barton for managing all the Q/A yahoos.
Tom Forge, who hasn't quite learned how to say "No"
Ileana Seander for not killing me every time I told her we're slipping a date.
Sharon Perry for the drop-shadows.
Fred Bowie for his 3rd base acrobatics.
Our good friends: "Big Al", Rose, Kurt, and the rest at Ottino's for lunch, dinner, dessert, TV, and popcorn.
Viola for poking my PRAM to kill the evil weird print monitor bug.
The gang at MindVision software (makers of Developer Vice installation software) for service above and beyond the call of duty.
All the great folks at SkyDance SkyDiving in Davis, CA who let John Lewis hurl himself out of their fine airplanes. (This may seem strange, but he says it helps him relax. Something about work not mattering much when hurtling towards the ground at 120+ MPH.)
