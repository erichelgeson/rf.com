				          			INDUSTRY DISPLAY/WINDOW

This button brings up a pop-up industry display.  Hold down the mouse button to view it.  You may 'tear away' the display to create an Industry window.  Drag the display away from the toolbar and release the mouse button.

This window shows information about the 11 different industry groups.  For each group you can display the national demand, your local tax rate and the ratio of local industries.
