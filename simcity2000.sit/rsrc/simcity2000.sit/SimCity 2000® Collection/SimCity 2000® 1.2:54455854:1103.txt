															POWER

Power Lines - Build these from your power plants to your zoned areas so they can start to build. These can cross roads and rails only at right angles. There is a slight transmission loss of power through these lines, so try to minimize the distance they have to traverse.

Power Plants - This will bring up a list of the currently available power plants that you may build. This list will grow as time passes and technology progresses.
