Extended Description: Silicon Valley - In the near future,
this mecca of High Tech has developed a new energy source:
solar power from space sent to earth-based receivers
via microwave beams.  Whoops, the beam missed the 
collection dish and has toasted many of the high tech busi-
nesses in the area.  Clean up the mess and rebuild the 
industrial population of the city to 48,000 in five years
to win this scenario.
