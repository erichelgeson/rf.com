Extended Description: Tokyo - The weather service has been tracking a massive hurricane, headed straight for Tokyo. The service is estimating unheard of wind speeds and is warning citizens to expect the worst. Using what little cash reserves you have left, you must clean up the mess and bring the population back up to 152,000 without adding Arcologies within 5 years. The weather service is calling it Hurricane Don.
