Extended Description: Davenport - In 1993, heavy rains, that
lasted weeks, sent much run-off into the Mississippi River.
As the water ran down to the Gulf of Mexico, it built up
so much that in some places it was 50 ft. above normal.  Fill
sandbags, mop up the mess and build your city to a 
population level of 118,000 in five years to win.
