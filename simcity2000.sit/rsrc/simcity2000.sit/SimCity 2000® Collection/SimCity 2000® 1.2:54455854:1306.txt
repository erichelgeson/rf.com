These are the 'percent' areas.  It shows either your current funding level or your current tax rate.
For most budget items, the percent is a number from zero to one hundred.  One hundred indicates full funding for that category.  Less than full funding has a detrimental effect on the given department:  Fire and police service smaller areas, hospitals help fewer people, transit cutbacks allow roads to decay, and education cutbacks result in a lowered EQ.
The percent next to Property Taxes indicates the average tax rate for all zones.  A higher rate returns more revenues but inhibits growth.  A lower rate encourages growth but returns less money.  Sometimes a lower rate can bring in more funds because the city grows larger.
