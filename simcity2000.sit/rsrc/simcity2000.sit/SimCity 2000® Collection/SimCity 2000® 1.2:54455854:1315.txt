This is your educational funding.  Without public schools, education is based on a verbal lore handed from parent to child.  Schools add to this Educational Quotient (EQ) and Colleges double EQ for 15-25 year olds.  Maintain 100% funding for several decades in order to improve the city EQ.  Schools cost $25 per year, Colleges cost $100 per year.
