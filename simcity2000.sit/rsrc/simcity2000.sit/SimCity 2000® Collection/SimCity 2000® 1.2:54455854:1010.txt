The Forest Arcology is named for its attractive forest setting on the top level.  Throughout the structure, citizens utilize recycling, operate ecologically sound industries, and maintain a rich verbal heritage that replaces television and radio.  Unfortunately, the youth of Forest Arcos are bored silly and roam out into your city where they stare mindlessly at soap operas and sports programs displayed in the electronics department at local malls.
Building a Forest Arcology costs $120,000 and can attract up to 30,000 residents.
