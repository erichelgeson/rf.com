This shows the estimated total revenues and expenses for the current or next budget year.  The number incorporates the year to date amount and makes an estimate based on the current city status. For example, if there were two police departments, the estimated cost would be $200 for the next year.  This number is subject to change, however.  If a police department were built or destroyed, or the funding levels changed in mid-year, then the actual year end amount would be different from the original estimate.
