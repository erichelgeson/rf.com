															EDUCATION ZONES

These special zones increase the "EQ" or education quotient of your residents over time. The EQ of your city will influence many factors including crime, productivity, and which industries prosper. Each type of zone affects different age groups and has a maintenance cost associated with it.

School - This represents primary and secondary education (from kindergarden to 12th grade). This will increase the EQ of the 5- to 20-year olds in your city. Of all education zones, these should be the most numerous in your city.

College - This represents higher education- universities, junior colleges and vocational schools. This zone increases the EQ of the 15- to 25-year-olds primarily, and the older residents as well, though to a lesser degree.

Library - This increases the EQ for all ages but to a lesser degree than the schools and colleges.

Museum - Like the library this zone increases the EQ for all ages. But the effect is more and so is the cost.
