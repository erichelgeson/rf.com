Most Important Stuff----------------------------** DISCLAIMER **The SimCity 2000 Urban Renewal Kit (SCURK from here on out) does many things that the designers of SimCity 2000 did not anticipate. As a result, lots of changes you can make to your graphics or saved cities in SCURK may have unpredictable effects when actually loaded back into SimCity 2000. We have taken every feasible precaution to protect against serious complications, such as crashing SimCity 2000 or confusing the simulator, but cannot guarantee that everything you do will work perfectly or even at all.Patching SimCity 2000 to Version 1.2SCURK generates object sets that contain replacement graphics for SimCity 2000. The current versions of SimCity 2000 (version 1.0 and 1.1) have no facilities for loading these object sets. Included in this package is an update program that will convert your SimCity 2000 1.0 or 1.1 to the most recent version (Version 1.2). Version 1.2 will support loading object sets and has many other enhancements over earlier versions.The update program should be run automatically after the SCURK installer has finished copying all of its files to your hard disk. If, for some reason, you need to re-install SimCity 2000, the update program can be run manually to patch the re-installed version of SimCity 2000 to version 1.2.What To Do If It Doesn't WorkSee the SimCity 2000 ReadmeMost of the troubleshooting information contained in the SimCity 2000 Readme file applies to SCURK. If you're having trouble getting SCURK working, try following everything in the SimCity 2000 Readme file.Increase SCURK's Preferred MemorySCURK is designed to run reasonably well in the 6.5 megabyte memory partition set in the Get Info window. However, creating extremely large object sets (where many objects are using the full height and width available) may consume more memory than SCURK allocates. If you find you are getting low memory messages while creating your works of art, you may wish to increase the Preferred Memory partition that SCURK allocates when launching. To do this, select the Urban Renewal Kit icon and from the Finder File menu, select Get Info. A dialog box will open displaying important properties for SCURK. Near the bottom of the dialog box will be an entry for "Preferred Size" with the number 6500 in it. That number is the amount of Kbytes reserved for SCURK when launching. Try increasing that number to 8000, then closing the information dialog box. The next time you launch SCURK, it will try to allocate 8 megabytes of memory. If you do not have 8 megabytes of memory available, you may get a warning message, or SCURK will just allocate what it can. You can increase the amount of memory available by closing other applications or increasing the amount of Virtual Memory on your Macintosh.Increase Your Virtual MemoryOn 4 meg machines, you will need to have virtual memory enabled to run SCURK. SCURK needs at least 6.5 megs of FREE memory to run, but this can include virtual memory. See the SCURK addendum for more information on how to increase virtual memory. If you should run out of memory while editing object sets or your city, SCURK will give you the option of saving your work before things start to get scary. If you find this is a regular problem, you may wish to increase the amount of RAM available. Either by installing more physical RAM, or by increasing the amount of virtual memory.Printer DriversSCURK has been successfully tested with several different Macintosh printer drivers. However, there are hundreds of different types of printers and many different versions of drivers for those hundreds of different printers. If SCURK does not print properly for you, your first action should be to test printing an image from another Mac program (such as MacPaint or Studio8 or Debabelizer). In general, if any other program can print an image, so can SCURK. If you can print an image fine with another program but SCURK does not print, try using the Generic Apple print drivers supplied with your Macintosh. If that fails, try getting the most recent version of the print drivers for your specific printer.SCURK on Smaller ScreensOn some smaller screens (Mac Classic and certain LC setups), the Paint The Town window does not completely fit on the screen. You can click in any non-tool area (basically any rivet background) and drag the window around to view the tools you need to use.Export PictTo export an image of your city as a Pict file, zoom your city in Place and Print to the location you wish to copy and press Commnad-# (shift-command-3). A file Picture 1 will be created in the working directory.II. Gameplay Issues----------------------------PrintingPrinting can take a really long time. In a worst-case scenario, printing a large map to a Postscript printer generates about 10 megs of data. If you only have 4 megs of real RAM and the rest in virtual memory, SCURK will be spending enormous amounts of time just swapping chunks in and out of memory in addition to actually having to generate the map. On slower machines with slower hard disks, be prepared to wait 15 or 20 minutes while the image is generating.SCURK Pict FilesPict files created of your city may look odd when imported into other programs. For instance, water may have interesting patterns and traffic may look pink. This is an artifact of the method SimCity 2000 uses to do animations (color cycling--see the SCURK manual for more info on that).SCURK and SimCity 2000¨If you have SCURK installed, SimCity 2000 will have a new menu option available to you. Load Object Set will load Object Sets created in SCURK into SimCity 2000. SimCity 2000 will remember the name of the last Object Set you loaded when you quit SimCity 2000 and load it the next time SimCity 2000 is launched. If SimCity 2000 cannot find the last loaded Object Set, it will default back to the original SimCity 2000 Object Set.When loading an Object Set with only a few new tiles (such as the Rome or London Object Sets included on the SimCity 2000 CD-ROM Collection), only those tiles will be replaced. The rest of the objects will carry over from the last set you loaded. This allows you to "layer"  Object Sets on top of each other. Remember that only the last set you loaded is recorded by SimCity 2000, so if you quit and re-launch SimCity 2000, you won't get any neat layering effect you might have previously been using.Cut and Paste ChangesWe decided to change the way the cut and paste system works in Paint The Town to make it a little more Mac-esque. The most obvious visual difference is that there is no paste mode or button. See the Macintosh addendum for more information on how Cut and Paste works in the Mac version of SCURK.Clipping Animated ObjectsDue to the way SimCity 2000 "clips" the edges of moving graphics to make sure they are erased properly as the graphic goes on, artwork for Airplanes, Ships, Tornadoes and such may leave "trails" behind as the objects move around your city. Trial and error is the best tool for learning what will leave a mess and what won't. Additionally, some of the animated objects are not drawn completely within the SCURK clip area. This includes the plane and ship. Should you edit these tiles, the original tile will probably be clipped. You can re-draw the plane or ship artwork a little higher up on the tile to avoid this problem.Zoning RulesIn the Place & Print utility, since abandoned buildings and construction zones have no default zone, here are the rules they follow when being placed:If you do not place the building on an existing zone, it will place with the last zone type you had selected (High Density Residential, Low Density Commercial, etc.).If any part of the building is touching a zone, the entire building will be placed as that zone.If you place a building not touching a zone with no zone ever having been chosen, it will default to High Density Residential.MicrosimulatorsBecause SimCity 2000 can store the names of microsimulator objects in saved games, we do not allow the microsimulator names in SCURK to overwrite the ones that have already been placed in SimCity 2000.Seaport Crane TilesSeaport cranes are what spawn piers, so when you bulldoze one tile of a pier, the entire pier blows up. Since the cranes and the piers share the same property, bulldozing one crane will demolish any cranes touching it.Holes in the WorldWhite spots may appear on city map printouts. This is an old problem with SimCity 2000 where, in certain situations, a change in altitude would be too steep for a sloping tile. Instead of a sloping tile, SimCity 2000 would just use a flat tile and a "hole" would be created underneath the "shelf" of the tile. This went fairly unnoticed since the background of SimCity 2000 was a similar color as the dirt. When printing, the background is the white paper instead of the brown screen, so the holes show up really well. Short of re-carving the hillside, or taking a crayon to your printout, there isn't much that can be done about this.SCURK Object Sets Versus the SimCity 2000 Object SetThe Urban Renewal Kit automatically generates the medium and small versions of your buildings for the medium and far views of your city in SimCity 2000. In the original set of artwork for SimCity 2000, our artists hand-touched up each size of building so that it would look good in all zoom levels. SCURK's object "munger" isn't nearly as good as our artists, so artwork drawn in SCURK probably will never look as good in the medium and far zoom views as the original stuff.SCURK Mac and SCURK WindowsThe Urban Renewal Kit for Mac reads and writes .MIF object file formats. This format is interchangeable between the Macintosh and Windows versions of SCURK and SimCity 2000, but are not compatible with the DOS version of SCURK and SimCity 2000. To convert object sets created in SCURK DOS (.TIL files) into .MIF files, you will need to use SCURK Windows to first convert the .TIL file to a .MIF file. The file can then be loaded into SCURK for the Mac.This text file is in the public domain and may be freely distributed.SimCity 2000 Urban Renewal Kit is NOT in the public domain and MAY NOT BE FREELY DISTRIBUTED.SimCity 2000 Urban Renewal Kit for the Macintosh - Copyright 1995 Maxis
