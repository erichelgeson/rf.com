As Mayor, you'll probably find this info. helpful to better understand and run your city (or to run your city, period!).Contents:I.

MOST IMPORTANT STUFF---------------------------------WHAT TO DO IF IT DOESN'T WORKRestart With Extensions OffSimCity 2000 has been tested with many, many extensions with few or noproblems--however, we cannot guarantee that there will not be conflicts. It'spossible that, if certain extensions are loaded in a certain order, or in certain configurations, SimCity 2000 might not work correctly. If you do have problems running SimCity 2000, we suggest re-starting with extensions off. To do this, select Restart from the Special menu, and hold down the Shift key until you see the "Welcome to Macintosh" screen with the text "Extensions Off." When you are finished playing SimCity 2000, restart your machine again and your extensions will load properly.Make Sure You Are Running in 32-Bit Mode (If Possible)In your Control Panel folder, select the Memory control panel and make sure that 32-Bit Addressing is enabled. Some machines will not have this option available. If this is the case, 32-bit addressing is probably not the source of the problem.Upgrade to Sound Manager 3.0We also recommend upgrading your system software with the Sound Manager 3.0. Sound Manager 3.0 has been included on your SimCity 2000 Disk 1. To install, drag the Sound and Sound Manager icons to your system folder. They will be put in the appropriate locations.Switch to 256 Colors (660av Users Especially)SimCity 2000 automatically switches your Macintosh to 256-color mode if it is not already set, and returns it to the original color depth when exiting. Some Macintoshes display erratic behavior when this happens (e.g., the Newspaper display draws pixels on the top area of your screen and doesn't display newspaper articles when you click on newspaper article headings). The solution is to manually switch your Macintosh color depth to 256. This is done in the Monitors control panel.Beware of Screen SaversCertain windows in SimCity 2000¨ may not re-draw after some screen savers have cleared the screen. This will leave you with a white window and no idea what to do with it. The buttons in these windows are still active; just keep clicking around until you hit something. In some situations, Delrina's Bill'n'Opus screen saver may conflict. We recommend disabling the screen saver while SimCity 2000 is running.Speed IssuesOn slower machines, you can improve performance by zooming all the way in and reducing the size of the edit window. Also, pausing the simulation will speed up the editing tools.Virtual MemorySimCity 2000 will work with Virtual Memory enabled, although performance will suffer noticeably.Importing/Exporting Files to SimCity 2000 DOS and SimCity ClassicSimCity 2000 Macintosh can import SimCity Classic Macintosh files directly from the Load Game dialog box. To import files from SimCity 2000 DOS or SimCity Classic DOS, you will need to add a bit of header information to tell your Macintosh that the file is a SimCity 2000 or SimCity Classic file. This can be done automatically through several DOS-to-Mac utilities (such as Apple File Exchange or Access PC) or through ResEdit (or any other file manipulation utility, such as Resourcerer). If the file is a SimCity Classic DOS file, you need to change the File Type to "CITY" and the Creator to "MCRP." If the file is a SimCity 2000 DOS file, you need to change the File Type to "CITY" and the creator to "SCDH." In ResEdit, this is done by opening the saved game file and selecting GET INFO FOR <cityname> (<cityname> will be whatever the name of the city is). There, you will find the entries for File Type and Creator. Be sure to do this on a backup of your city file, just in case something goes wrong.Problems With Games Imported From SimCity ClassicIn SimCity Classic, it was possible to use the bulldoze tool to cut a hole in residential zones and place another zone in that hole. When these cities are imported into SimCity 2000, the resulting structure may appear as a brown rectangle (kind of like a hole in the world). To clean this up, you'll need to bulldoze that area and re-zone over it. The brown rectangle won't cause any problems; it just looks ugly. Certain other configurations of bridges and objects may also cause these brown holes. You can use the Query tool to see what kind of object should be there and then bulldoze the area and rebuild it if you like. In addition, be aware that rails no longer work properly without rail depots. Cities that are based solely around rail systems without roads will fail unless you place down some railroad depots where Sims can get on and off the trains.Loading SCURK Object SetsIf you have SCURK installed, a new button will appear in the New Game window and a new menu option will become available in the File menu. These will allow you to load Object Sets from the SimCity 2000 Urban Renewal Kit into SimCity 2000. You cannot import .TIL sets from the Urban Renewal Kit for DOS--they must be converted in the Urban Renewal Kit for Windows. When importing an object set, only the tiles that exist in the set will affect SimCity 2000. If you have an object set with only 2 buildings (such as the Landmark object sets included on the SimCity 2000 CD-ROM collection), only those two tiles will be replaced in SimCity 2000 when loaded. When you exit and re-load SimCity 2000, it will try to read in the last object set you loaded before the last time you exited SimCity 2000. If it cannot find that object set, it will default back to the original object set.You may load tile sets on top of object sets to create a completely original set, but when SimCity 2000 is exited and re-launched, only the most recent object set will be loaded.When loading object sets, you may get a message stating that you are low on memory. SimCity 2000 will do its best to clean up the memory available and give you a chance to exit any other applications you may have running in an attempt to create enough space to load the new object set. SimCity 2000 will keep loading objects from the object set until it does run out of memory, so you may end up with a city that has half original tiles and half new tiles.II.	GAMEPLAY ISSUES---------------------------------Micro-Simulators (Important!)When querying some structures, you get specific information about that structure. For instance, querying a police station will tell you how many crimes and arrests were handled by that station, and querying a school will tell you how many teachers and students are attending, as well as the average grade of the students. Most placeable structures have these micro-simulators (police and fire stations, schools, colleges, most power plants, the Mayor's House, arcologies, etc.).Some structures share one micro-simulator for all the structures placed. Things like bus stations, railroad depots, marinas, libraries, windmills, and hydroelectric power plants, among others, have one micro-simulator for each category (one micro-simulator for all the bus stations, one for all the railroad depots, etc.). Where is all this headed, you ask? Well, each city can only have 150 micro-simulators in it. If you go beyond that, the structure you place will still affect your city (police stations will still stop crime, bus stations will still carry passengers, arcologies will still hold people, etc.); you just won't be able to see any in-depth information on those structures. This isn't going to harm your city in any way. We're just telling you this because it's pretty easy to run out of micro-simulators in a large city and we don't want you thinking something's wrong.Newspaper StrikesSometimes, SimCity 2000 will not be able to load the newspaper into available memory. In these cases, the newspaper will go "on strike." We recommend freeing up more memory for SimCity 2000 by quitting other open applications or restarting with extensions off (see above).Terrain EditingIf you are building a city and go into the terrain edit mode, your city will disappear, but any trees or water that you have placed in the city will show up in terrain edit mode. Also, if you have placed a bridge or other structure that needs to build landfill, it will also show up in terrain edit mode. These can be removed with the lower terrain or level terrain tools.AirportsKeep in mind that when building an airport it needs space for a runway, or it will not build. Your best bet is to build the airport 2 tiles by 6 tiles, and make sure that no tall buildings are nearby; SimCity 2000 pilots are not known for their avoidance skills! In addition, make sure that airports are adequately powered. Some airport tiles will not build unless power lines are run to that tile (just to be safe, we recommend covering the entire airport area with power lines).Water Pumps"I keep adding pumps, but I don't see water in this part of my city!" Water does not flow from pumps (it does in reality, but not in SimCity 2000). It flows from the center of your city (more or less). Zoom out and view your entire city to see if the pumps/towers/etc. you have just added are having any effect. Also, remember that pumps need to be powered and connected via pipes to the rest of your water network to contribute.Funny Noises"My computer is making explosions, but nothing is blowing up!" or "What's that funny growling I hear?" The explosions are most likely from airplanes crashing into tall buildings in the flight path. If you have No Disasters selected, the planes will crash and blow up, but there will be no resulting damage or fire. The growling could be from a zoo...or it could be from that which lurks below the surface of the lake....Dispatching"I placed thirty or forty fire trucks to put out my fire, and now when I try to place more it just makes a noise, but I don't see anything." SimCity 2000 can only handle about thirty or forty dispatched units at once, and any units placed after that do not appear and don't do any good. (Pretend that you only have a forty-channel emergency radio.)Trains, Planes and CarsSometimes these things get stuck (in the case of planes and trains) or look like they don't connect (in the case of roads or rails). Don't worry about it--just because things look ugly doesn't mean they really are. Your Sims are still happily flying around or commuting just like they're supposed to.HotkeysSHIFT--Press while dragging a zone, power line, road, rail, or other draggable item to cancel the placement.          - Hold down to temporarily turn cursor into the Query tool.          - Hold down and click on buttons or windows to get Help.          - Hold down using the Tree tool in the Terrain Edit Mode to remove trees.B--Hold down to temporarily turn the cursor into the Bulldoze tool.OPTION--Hold down to temporarily turn the cursor into the Centering tool.HOME--Zooms the view in one level.END--Zooms the view out one level.DEL--Rotates the world 90 degrees counter-clockwise.PAGEDOWN--Rotates the world 90 degrees clockwise.CURSOR KEYS--Scrolls the view of the world.New in Version 1.2What's new in 1.2?Support for the Urban Renewal Kit has been installed. If you have the Urban Renewal Kit, you will have the option to load Object Set tiles into SimCity 2000. Note--You must RUN the Urban Renewal Kit once before SimCity 2000 knows it is installed.PowerMac Native Mode! SimCity 2000 is now a Fat Binary. This means there is both 68000 and PowerPC chip source code in SimCity 2000. It should SCREAM on PowerMac machines.African Swallow Mode. At goinpoint, we forced the programmers to remove all safety settings and allow the user to select the infinitely dangerous (and fast) African Swallow speed setting. Caution! Using this setting will cause SimCity 2000 to not draw any screen updates (well, ok, it draws them once every few game-months), not to time itself against your system's clock, and may cause rips in the fabric of the universe if used improperly. If you have selected this newly-declassified speed setting and a disaster occurs, SimCity 2000 will spit out of Swallow mode (oh, wait, I can't say that) so you can fight the forces of evil in real-time.Legal StuffResEdit, Apple File Exchange, Sound Manager 3.0, Resourcerer and Access PC are copyrights of their respective owners.
