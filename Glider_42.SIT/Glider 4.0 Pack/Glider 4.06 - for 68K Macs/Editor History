Room Editor 1.0 Version History1.00•	original release.1.01•	wow, I have no idea what I added to this upgrade!1.02•	handle the mix-up when checking 'deep' resource in art files•	updated Casady & Greene, Inc. address in About Room Editor 1.0… dialog box (thanks for moving guys and gals).•	got rid of that Glider 1.0 panel that would come up in About Room Editor 1.0… box.1.03•	renamed art files to "B&W Art" and "Color Art".•	upgraded to "About… 2.1" library (thanks Mr. Wind).•	added a color animated cursor (just like Glider 4.05).•	opening art files is 'smarter' (i.e. will first check for appropriate default file names - if in color mode, the Editor looks for "Color Art").•	fixed the 'glide ratio' bug where the glider flew farther in the Room Editor with respect to Glider itself (yes!!! I found it!!!).•	the "House Info…" dialog box now supports locking of a house (you can't unlock it though)•	the grease is now "operational" - you can slide along it.1.04•	re-aligned wall switch, thermostat, & toggle switch's bounds rects.  Also, added check on bounds rects of these objects for houses created pre-1.04 (note - persons creating houses with 1.04 or later Room Editor will see some horizontal shrinking of these objects when opened with pre-1.04 Room Editor or played with a pre-4.06 Glider).
