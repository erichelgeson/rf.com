ContentsBesides this Read Me, the Glider 4.0 Pack should contain:Glider 4.06 - for 68K MacsGlider 4.09 - for PPC MacsRoom Editor 1.04More Gliderª (an add-on disk that was sold separately)Houses from the Web (18 fan-made houses)Extra Folder IconSystem RequirementsGlider 4.0 can run on any Mac from a Plus (with 1MB of RAM and System 6 or better) on up, so long as the monitor can be set to "Black and White" or "16 Colors" mode. If your monitor can only go as low as 256 colors, Glider 4.0 will probably crash.Glider 4.06 versus 4.09Glider 4.06 used a better sound handling system that could play multiple sounds at once, but this system had to be removed from 4.09 because it was incompatible with newer hardware. Use 4.06 if you have a 68K machine, and 4.09 if you have a PowerMac. (If you aren't sure, try 4.06 and see if the game's sounds are overlaid with annoying static.) Then throw away the version you don't need.Playing Custom HousesTo play a custom house, you must first drag it into the same folder as the Glider application itself. You can keep any number of custom houses in the Glider folder. To play a custom house, choose 'Load House' from the Game menu.Using the Room EditorSimilarly, in order to use the Room Editor, you must drag the Room Editor application into the same folder as Glider itself. (Otherwise, the program gets confused and can't remember where its Art files are.)
