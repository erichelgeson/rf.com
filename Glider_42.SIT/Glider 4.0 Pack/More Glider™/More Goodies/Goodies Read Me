11/27/92About the Goodies!"Improved Art Files.sea" is a compressed archive which contains the new Color Art and B&W Art files. To decompress them, simply doubleclick on the "Improved Art Files.sea" icon and choose where you want the new art files put.*** NOTE!!!  These files display properly with Glider 4.05 or later!  If you have Glider versions 4.00-4.04, you'll need to upgrade.  To receive the latest version of Glider 4.0, send in your original diskettes, along with a self addressed stamped envelope to: Casady & Greene, Inc., Upgrades Department, 22734 Portola Drive, Salinas, CA 93908-1119. ***¥ Color ArtThe "Color Art" file is a modified version of the original color art file that shipped with Glider 4.0.  Some of the objects have been slightly altered (for example, look for the "flying-V" guitar).  To use this file, drop it into your Glider 4.0 folder.  Make sure you have a back-up of the original color art file so that it isn't totally lost!  (Versions of Glider 4.0 before 4.05 called the color art file "Art 16" - you can either rename the file on this disk to "Art 16" or, when you run Glider 4.0, it will ask you where the graphics file is - simply select "Color Art").¥ B&W ArtThe "B&W Art" file is a modified version of the original B&W art file that shipped with Glider 4.0.  Some of the objects have been slightly altered (for example, look for the "flying-V" guitar).  To use this file, drop it into your Glider 4.0 folder.  Make sure you have a back-up of the original B&W art file so that it isn't totally lost!  (Versions of Glider 4.0 before 4.05 called the B&W art file "Art 2" - you can either rename the file on this disk to "Art 2" or, when you run Glider 4.0, it will ask you where the graphics file is - simply select "B&W Art").¥ Zero 2-20This is a little application that will clear all high scores EXCEPT for #1 (as in, 2 through 20).  It is handy for clearing all but your best score when you want to give others an opportunity to at least get ON the high scores.
