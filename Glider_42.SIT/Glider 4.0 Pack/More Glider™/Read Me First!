The More Glider disk contains:		* 8 Glider Houses for use with Glider 4.0		* Zero 2-20 - an application to clear the high scores table		* Improved Art files that alters the look of Glider houses  “Mad House” is an extremely challenging house John Calhoun designed as a follow on to the original House in Glider 4.0.	In the “More Houses” folder, there are seven additional houses built by very creative Glider 4.0 Players.  Because we included a room editor with Glider 4.0, some creative people have designed some sensational houses.• What to do with all these new houses:-  Copy "Mad House" and "Mad House 2" from the "More Glider" disk to your Glider 4.0 folder.-  Drag the contents of the "More Houses" folder from the "More Glider" disk to your Glider 4.0 folder.• Playing the many new houses- Double click on Glider 4.0._ Select "Load House…."  in the "Game" menu.- When the dialog box appears, select a house to play. Do not select a house with a number.  For example, to play Mad House, do not select Mad House 2.- Tip!  Every time you start up Glider 4.0 you will have to always select "Load House…" since the game will default to the original "The House."  To avoid this and, say, have Glider 4.0 default to "Mad House", just move "The House" out of your Glider 4.0 folder.  When you start Glider 4.0, it will tell you that it can't find the default house and will ask you to select a house as the default house.  Select "Mad House" or whatever.  From that point on, Glider 4.0 will always default to that house when it starts up.• Many thanksIf you've tried to make your own houses with the Room Editor, you may have come to the same two conclusions that I have: 1) making even a 40 room house is a lot of work (months to get it polished and to afford you time to make each next room interesting) and 2) playing a house that you yourself created isn't nearly as fun as flying through a house you've never seen before.  For this reason, I want to thank the people who contributed their time and houses to this disk.  They are: Jeff Carter, Brian Eaton, Tony Korlath and Steve Sullivan.  Of the many houses I've seen, their houses were among the finest.  Thankfully, they further cleaned and polished up their houses and allowed me the rights so that I could offer them on this disk.  Hopefully, there are enough houses here to keep you busy exploring new rooms for months and months.  I know easily that much work has gone into creating these.  Have fun!_ John Calhoun/1992
