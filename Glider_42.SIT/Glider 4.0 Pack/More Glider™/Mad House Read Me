Welcome to the Mad House!This is a very difficult house to get through.  I don't want to spoil it too much with a lot of hints, but I will reveal that the house is something of a maze.  There are many, many rooms where you have several ways you can go.  Some directions lead to certain entrapment and no return, while others lead to the way out.  A final hint: there are a lot of tough rooms where timing is VERY critical.  This house is for the people who thought the original house (The House) was too easy.  Good luck!john calhoun-
