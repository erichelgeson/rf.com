House File Structure:
The house you are creating or modifying can be thought of on three levels.
• the house
• the rooms
• the objects

The house contains rooms which contain objects.  As well, several house files can be linked together as if part of one large house.

The House:
The house contains rooms and information that applies across ALL rooms and objects.  The house contains:
 - a name for the house
 - the high scores for that house
 - the version of the editor that created the house
 - the name of the background file the house uses
 - the name of the house file that follows (if any)
 - the first house file (if any)
 - the number of rooms (max. = 40)
You can modify these by selecting the House Info menu item from under the Windows menu.

The Rooms:
Each of the rooms in the house contains additional information about that specific room.  A room contains objects and all objects are subject to this room.  The room information includes:
 - a name for the room
 - the number of the room in the house
 - the background used for that room
 - the ordering of the background “tiles”
 - the type of enemy craft in that room
 - the number of these enemy craft (if any)
 - the time delay between the appearance of these craft
 - the condition of the room (normal, unlit, blowers off)
 - the number of objects (max. = 16)
You can modify these by selecting the Room Background Info menu item and the Room Condition Info from the Windows menu.  Double-clicking in the room will bring up the Room Condition Info dialog box.

The Objects:
The objects are dragged off the object palette (select Show Object Palette from the Windows menu).  Each object has it's unique attributes.  Many of the attributes can be modified directly on the object (select the object and drag the objects “handle” or move the object around).  Some objects will require calling the Object Info menu from the Windows menu.
